    ## 1. Component Overview

    - **OmniGuard** is a reasoning based conversation moderation system for text-based LLM interactions.
    - It continuously runs rule violation assessments for each turn of user and assistant messages against a configurable set of content rules.
    - OmniGuard actively sanitizes minor violations and probes for clarification in ambiguous cases, thereby preserving an engaging and meaningful dialogue while upholding safety standards.
    - The system effectively mitigates the majority of potential violations and attacks through its comprehensive rule set and reasoning-based approach. Together, we're building a safer, more robust AI ecosystem that strengthens our collective defense against emerging threats.
    
    >Note: This is not intended to be a full AI security solution; rather, it is designed to effectively protect wrappers from most attacks without decreasing the performance of the Assistant.</span>

    ## 2. System Flow

    1. **Configuration**  
       - The safety configuration which includes the Purpose, Instructions, and Rules is injected into the `role.developer.content` field.
       - This configuration primes OmniGuard with all necessary guidelines and behavioral protocols before any messages are processed.
    
    2. **Message Handling**  
       - OmniGuard inspects every incoming message to assess compliance with the active rules.
       - If a violation is detected, OmniGuard either sanitizes minor issues or, in cases of major violations, replaces the message with a safe, generic refusal.
       - When ambiguity exists, OmniGuard proactively asks for clarification to fully understand the user's intent before finalizing a moderation decision.

    ### 3.1 Configuration and Input Injection Strategy

    Inject these components using the following message format:
    ```json
    { "role": "developer", "content": {"type": "text", "text": "<CONFIGURATION>"} }
    { "role": "user", "content": {"type": "text", "text": "<INPUT>"} }

    The configuration is composed of three main components:
    
    - **Purpose:** Defines OmniGuard as a reasoning-based moderation layer that evaluates and safeguards conversational content through dynamic moderation and context understanding.
    - **Instructions:** Comprehensive guidelines covering:
        - Core operational role and message evaluation process
        - Handling of ambiguous cases and clarification requests
        - Response strategies for violations
        - Maintaining conversational engagement
        - Input format requirements
    - **Rules:** Organized into three major groups:
        1. **Content Moderation (CM):** Rules for detecting hate speech, explicit content, and inflammatory language
        2. **Data Leakage Prevention (DLP):** Protection against PII exposure, corporate data leaks, and credential sharing
        3. **Adversarial Attacks (AA):** Comprehensive defenses against:
            - Direct/Indirect Prompt Injection
            - Contextual/Few-Shot Injection
            - Encoding/Obfuscation Techniques
            - Multi-Step/Progressive Escalation
            - Roleplay-Based Attacks
            - System Override Attempts
            - Instructional Inconsistency Exploitation
            - Model Inversion/Data Extraction
            - Prompt Leakage Exploits
            - Jailbreak Chaining Methods
            - Instruction-Following Bias Exploitation
            - Multimodal Adversarial Attacks

    #### Safety Rules

    Each rule group includes:
    - **Group:** The category of rules (e.g., Content Moderation, Data Leakage Prevention, Adversarial Attacks)
    - **Rules:** A list where each rule contains:
      - **id:** A unique identifier (e.g., CM1, DLP1, AA1)
      - **description:** A detailed explanation of what the rule detects/prevents
      - **examples:** Multiple illustrative cases showing:
        - User violation examples
        - Assistant failure examples (marked as [Major] or [Minor])

    ```json
    {
        "conversation_id": "string",
        "analysisSummary": "string",
        "compliant": boolean,

            "RefuseUser | RefuseAssistant": "string"
        }
    }
    ```

    Conversations must follow this structure:
    ```json
    <input>
        {
          "id": "{{id}}",
          "messages": [
            { "role": "system", "content": "{{assistant_system_prompt}}" },
